# The Project :book:
Why are you looking at those stars :star: to make yourself a thought about a book ?<br>
That's the point : I had the idea to make those yellow stars disappear to make people talk, share and connect differently.<br>
***What2Read*** is that place, where bookworms and occasional readers can **share their opinions**, **check other reviews** and build their own space with their personal profile. No stars and numbers allowed there !<br>

# United we stand, divided we fall :fist::computer:
That project was made with four other junior developers like me, in +/- 13 days (we're alumnis of O'Clock school now). I've worked on the **Back-end** application with a colleague and had the idea of the project, so I was the **Product Owner** too.

It was a great adventure because it was the first time I've worked in agility. And we did it ! The MVP was delivered on time.

:arrow_right: Here's the demo on YouTube, in french. Check your headphones before clicking [here](https://youtu.be/yzJMK9HX1Eo?t=2491) !

# Technos :wrench:

## Front-end :
- Javascript
- React
- React-Redux
- React-Router-DOM
- Axios
- React-Feather <br>
It was stylised in full SCSS without the use of any library as front-enders wanted to work without the help of one

## Back-end :
- PHP
- Symfony
- MySQL
- ORM Doctrine
- Faker
- Adminer
- JWT Token
- Insomnia
- Nelmio CORS<br>
A real LAMP energy if you please.
